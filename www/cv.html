			<br/>
			I have a friendly and sympathetic manner and fit in well with others. I am
			punctual, helpful and have a wonderful sense of humour. I have an
			outstanding attendance and behavioural record. An enthusiastic worker who
			has a practical and logical approach to tasks as demonstrated in previous
			roles working as a hands on labourer/tiler. I’m someone who enjoys learning
			new skills and has a can-do approach to challenges in the workplace. A
			lively team member who can offer excellent customer service and strong
			resilience. Has the ability to gain product knowledge in order to increase
			sales. A person who has knowledge of Health and Safety as well as having
			strong communication skills. I have had a plethora of achievements
			throughout my school time including a certificate for an original piece of
			creative writing that was selected for publication in a young writers
			anthology, a Canterbury academy Oscar for key stage 4 film and media,
			multiple celebration of talent certificates from the Canterbury academy in
			various subjects, and during the summer of 2017 I was selected to attend
			the university of Kent summer school and received a certificate for my
			attendance there. I was also accepted for the BFI Film Academy Network and
			made a professional short film. I was one of 66 selected (out of hundreds)
			to take part on the BFI Craft Skills Residential hosted at the National
			film and Television School where I was involved in making a short film that
			was shown at the BFI Southbank Theatre. Now seeking a new employment
			opportunity. Available for interview and immediate start.

			I adore making small films and skits with my friends that I write, direct,
			film and then edit myself using my computer and specialist software. I have
			made a short film for the BFI Film Academy as well as have made an 8 minute
			short film for Network Rail that will be shown around schools to educate
			about railway safety. I have completed other projects that I am proud of in
			media and I’m always looking for more.
