					This is a behind the scenes mini I made for Screen South (parters of BFI) for their website to advertise the short course that I was on. 
					<br>This film was completely optional and made entirely by me with the tutors giving me complete creative control.
					<br>The challenges I faced when creating this would not be apparent to me straight away. It took until the edit for me to
					<br>realise that there was a very limited amount of footage for me to use, so I had to be smart and think effciantly. I think the
					<br>overall edit came out nicely and I'm happy they chose to use it for their site.

					This is the actual film I made with Screen South (partners of BFI) while on my course with them. The course was a very good experiance for
					<br>me, not only because I made some crucial contacts and got a priceless experiance but because I also got a bronze arts award from attending.
					<br>The thing that bugs me with this film is that I'm only credited as "sound" when in actual fact I edited half the film. The original editor didn't attending
					<br>the editing session and therefore I jumped in and edited the rest of the film myself to save the project. The film came out okay, I think it could have been much
					<br>better if I had a bigger part in the editing. I think the colour garding on the film is very dark and the sound design fluctuates too much bit these are only nit picks
					<br>as I'm a perfectionist. I am proud to have been part of the project however.

					Trespass is a film I made in partnership with Southeastern Railway. The idea behind the film was to inform people (specifically school kids) about the
					<br>dangers crossing a train track. Me and my 5 fellow pupils from my Media Studies class collabarativly worked on the project (I edited it independantly).
					<br>We were invited kindly by them to film on one of their offline railway tracks and provided us with some train instructiors and police staff to interview.
					<br>They were happy with the outcome of the project and most importantly my edit and now use it to show around schools as a informative message.

					This is is my most recent independant project that I wrote, directed, filmed, produced and sourced entirely by myself. I had some help from a couple friends
					<br>to set up and carry equipment. I am very proud of this film as it encpulates my style of creation. I do belive the project on the whole is very amatuer,
					<br>but thats because I had Â£0 budget and just me to work on it creatively. The original version of the script called for a much more complling story between
					<br>the main charcters but it was just physically imposible to make with the reasources I had at my disposal. I think with the time I had and the changes I had
					<br>to make the film came out impressively good given its original history.

				<div class="videoparagraphleft">
					Don't get me started on this film. I made this for my EPQ (Extended Project Qualification). The topic I chose to explore was how the effects of suicide can effect us mentally.
					<br>I sourced all my references and researched as much as I could about cinema conventions and tropes to give as much of an unbiased, inoffensive film as I possibly could.
					<br>I had always had this idea that i wanted to encorporate a familar fairy tale into a film so much that you couldn't tell it was the same story until someone pointed out that
					<br>this film is based off of x, and then in that moment their whole perspective of the film, theme and fairy tale would change. Its always been a pipedream of mine and this is
					<br>what I based the film and script off. I filmed it and even edited it and it came out just the way I had envisioned but then tragedy struck. The starring actor wanted the film
					<br>to be removed due to a personal issue. I respected this and removed the film. This left me with only a week to rewrite and refilm the entire film. With this time I made a very
					<br>different, much more metaphorical film that makes very little sense without the original script. On the bright side I learnt alot of diffent valuable lessons.

				<div class="videoparagraphrightbroken">
					This is a project I made for BTEC Media. The unit was stopmotion. The school brought in an outside expert to work with us for the week. Me being me, I decided that I wanted
					<br>to experiment and learn as much as I could. I wanted it to be as wacky and as much of a culmination of who I am as a person as possible. I love putting my personality, 
					<br>views and thoughts in my work. This film got me a distinction. I really enjoyed being able to express myself creativly (even though I am not the most experianced 
					<br>sculpter). Every time I rewatch this piece it brings mejoy because I know this is entirely me and isn't that what lifes all about, being you and no one else.
